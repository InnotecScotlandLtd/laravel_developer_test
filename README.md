# Innotec Laravel Developer Test

## Instructions
Thank you for taking the time to apply for a Laravel developer position with Innotec. Please complete and return the test within 48 hours of receipt. The task should take no more than 2 hours. Please fully read this guide and contact us if you have any questions.

### Task
Build a simple authenticated Laravel website with a dashboard, that can only be accessed via a login. The dashboard should be populated via a REST API of your choice. You are also required to upload it to a public repo (preferably Github, but Bitbucket etc is fine.) and send us a link to the repo.

As this test is specific to Laravel, we don't care so much about what data source you use, which front-end framework is used etc, what we will be evaluating is the following:

* A clear and strong understanding of Object Oriented PHP
* Effective use of design patterns
* Design principles such as DRY, SOLID etc
* Coding standards
* Best Laravel practices
* API handling
* Security
* Validation

### Task specifications:
* A login page – this should accept an email address and password, as well as handle any errors.
* A dashboard – this should only be accessible after logging in and will contain a table of data. This can be populated with any dataset of your choice. We suggest consuming a public API somewhere such as [Awesome public Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-publicdatasets) (feel free to use whatever you wish though).
* A piece of functionality of your choice that allows you to display your strengths as a developer. This can be anything you like, and gives you the opportunity to stand out from the crowd!

At a minimum it should take an email address and password, have a submit button, reject invalid users and accept valid ones. Once validated, you should be taken to the dashboard which will display the table of data consumed by your API.

#### Bonus points:
* Automated testing
* Sorting and filtering
* Search functionality
* Pagination
* Well written Readme / Documentation

#### Helpful information
Don't waste time on how the site looks - we would much prefer the time is spent showcasing your PHP Knowledge and skills. The same goes for functionality that is already part of Laravel - there is no point in wasting time re-creating functionality such as logging in or pagination when Laravel's own implementation is more than suffice for the task.

Good luck!

#Innotec Laravel Developer Test
##Instructions
Thank you for taking the time to apply for a Laravel developer position with Innotec. Please complete and return the test within 48 hours of receipt. The task should take no more than 2 hours. Please fully read this guide and contact us if you have any questions.
###TaskBuild a simple authenticated Laravel website with a dashboard, that can only be accessed via a login. The dashboard should be populated via a REST API of your choice. You are also required to upload it to a public repo (Github, Bitbucket etc.) and send us a link to the repo.

As this test is specific to Laravel, we don't care so much about what data source you use, which front-end framework is used etc, what we will be evaluating is the following:

* A clear and strong understanding of Object Oriented PHP
* Best Laravel practices* Design principles such as DRY, SOLID etc
* Effective use of design patterns* Coding standards* API handling* Security* Validation
###Task specifications:
* A login page – this should accept a username and password, as well as handle any errors.* A dashboard – this should only be accessible after logging in and will contain a table of data. This can be populated with any dataset of your choice. We suggest consuming a public API somewhere such as [Awesome public Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-publicdatasets) (feel free to use whatever you wish though).
At a minimum it should take a username and password, have a submit button, reject invalid users and accept valid ones. Once validated, you should be taken to the dashboard which will display the table of data consumed by your API.
####Bonus points:
* GIT conventions* Testing* Documentation* Search functionality* Pagination* Sorting and filtering
